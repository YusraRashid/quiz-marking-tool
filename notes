How to allow for multiple entries:

arrayOfPossibleAnswers = answersArray[answerIndex].answers

with formattedAnswer, perform distance operation forEach of the possibleAnswers. If distance < 2 then answer is correct





Actually, instead of forEach, use a map to create a new array of numbersOfDistance. if either of those numbers of distance is less than 3, isCorrect = true.
